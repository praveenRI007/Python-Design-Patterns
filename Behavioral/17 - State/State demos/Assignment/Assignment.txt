You're happy with the shopping cart development so far.  However, you just 
received a new requirement:

A customer should be able to suspend his shopping at any point in time and
resume shopping later.  That means a new state: suspended and two new 
transistions: suspend and resume

Additionally, you realized you really don't need all the chatty feedback 
in the current state objects.  Eliminate that but leave in some code
to raise an appropriate exception if some transition is called while in 
wrong state.
