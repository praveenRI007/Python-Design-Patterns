A real-life family is represented using the composite pattern developed
in this module.  Unfortunately, following a death in the family, the
will of the departed must be executed.  The will stipulates that the
deceased's estate must be converted to cash and distributed evenly
amongst the individuals in the family according to this formula:

1. The first generation receives an equal proportion of the value of
the estate

2. If a member of the first generation is a composite, that portion
will be further divided amongst its members and following the same
rule, its descendants

After holding an auction, the grand sum of $314,159.36 is realized as
cash. Modify the code to distribute this amongst the heirs according
to the formula given, showing at least two decimal places
