Assume that the the Customer class separated the name attribute into first name 
and last name. Then, a program written against the Vendor class would need a 
way to retrieve a single name property.

Write and test a Vendor/Customer object adapter that is two-way.  Like the 
VendAdapter in the examples, it looks like a Customer to clients using that 
interface and it also needs to look like a Vendor to clients using the Vendor
class.
